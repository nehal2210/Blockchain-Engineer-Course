// Gas
// How much ether do you need to pay for a transaction?
// You pay gas spent * gas price amount of ether, where

// gas is a unit of computation
// gas spent is the total amount of gas used in a transaction
// gas price is how much ether you are willing to pay per gas
// Transactions with higher gas price have higher priority to be included in a block.

// Unspent gas will be refunded.

// Gas Limit
// There are 2 upper bounds to the amount of gas you can spend

// gas limit (max amount of gas you're willing to use for your transaction, set by you)
// block gas limit (max amount of gas allowed in a block, set by the network)
